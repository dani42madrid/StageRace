you’ve defined t_race_data and t_runner_data. Next, we need to add a mutex to 
t_race_data so threads can safely print and decide who wins without stepping 
on each other.

Why? Because multiple threads might try to print or set the “winner” at the 
same time, causing garbled output or two winners.

What you need:
1. A variable of type pthread_mutex_t inside t_race_data.
2. Calls to initialize and destroy that mutex in your setup/cleanup.

To allow threads to lock before printing or setting the winner, you need a mutex 
inside t_race_data. A mutex is a special variable (pthread_mutex_t) that owns a 
“lock” – only one thread can hold it at a time.

1. Include the pthread header at the top of stagerace.h: 
	#include <pthread.h>
2. Add the mutex field to your t_race_data struct:
	pthread_mutex_t print_mutex;
